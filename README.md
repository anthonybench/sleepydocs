# CHEAT SHEET



## Basic Styles
Text can be bold, italic or strike-through.\
Underline is not supported by either engine.
```markdown
**I'm bold**
*I'm italic*
~~I'm strike-through~~
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />\
**I'm bold**\
*I'm italic*\
~~I'm strike-through~~

<br /><hr>

## Code Snippets
Code snippets can be either `inline` by wrapping with one back-tick, or block by wrapping with three back-ticks. Block can't be shown here without escapes "`\`", so note that the block snippet examples have backslashes that you should omit:
```markdown
`inline snippet`
\```
block snippet,
but remove the backslashes.
\```
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />\
`inline snippet`
```
block snippet,
but remove the backslashes.
```

Block snippets have more flexibility, as you can **specify the language for proper syntax highlighting** by appending the first triple back-tick wrapper with the language name or the file extension letters (*sometimes*):
```markdown
\```csharp
// omit backslashes
public class Flop {
    public Flop() {}

    public int a {get; set;}
    private string b;
}
\```
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />

```csharp
// omit backslashes
public class Flop {
    public Flop() {}

    public int a {get; set;}
    private string b;
}
```

<br /><hr>

## Horizontal Rules, Line Breaks
Horizontal rules are lines that span the page body, typically up to margins. Both paragraph line breaks and horizontal rules are set with HTML tags like so:
```markdown
<hr>
<br>
```

For **in-paragraph line breaks**:
```markdown
Hello\
World
```
Note that **two spaces will also set a paragraph line break**.

<br /><hr>

## Block Quotes
Block quotes look good for a wide range of use-cases, in fact seldom ever used for quoting some other source. For support in both engines, start each line of a block quote with "`>`" like so:
```markdown
> block quotes\
> are so\
> groovy
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />

> block quotes\
> are so\
> groovy

<br /><hr>

## Lists
**Unordered**, with nesting:
```markdown
- one fish
- two fish
    - red fish
    - blue fish
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />

- one fish
- two fish
    - red fish
    - blue fish

**Ordered**, with nesting:
```markdown
1. hello
2. world
   1. my name
   2. is sleepy boy
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />

1. hello
2. world
   1. my name
   2. is sleepy boy

**Task list**, with nesting:
```markdown
- [ ] unchecked
- [x] checked
    - [ ] weeble wop
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />

- [ ] unchecked
- [x] checked
  - [ ] weeble wop

You may nest any type of list with any other type of list.

<br /><hr>

## Tables
Worthy of mention, there is a popular *JavaScript* extension for *Markdown* called **Mermaid** that allows you to set UML diagrams, flow charts and other graphical flaire. Neither of the focus platforms support this, though *Stack Edit* does, and you can read more [here](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).

As for standard tables:
```markdown
| Col 1 | Col 2 |
| --- | --- |
| tables | don't you |
| are fun | think so? |
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />

| Col 1 | Col 2 |
| --- | --- |
| tables | don't you |
| are fun | think so? |

## Usefull HTML Tags
HTML tags are a bit of a tricky subject, as the two environments differ quite a lot. Essentially, *VS Code* attempts to support as much HTML as possible, while *GitHub* is very picky. A couple tags accepted in both arenas given here (image tag shown later).\
**Acronyms**:
```markdown
<abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />

<abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>

**Superscripts** and **subscripts**:
```makrdown
Hello <sup>world</sup>
Hello <sub>world</sub>
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />

Hello <sup>world</sup>\
Hello <sub>world</sub>

<br /><hr>

## Colors, Fonts
*VS Code* only‚ùó With html tags such as `<span style="font-family:Papyrus">LOVE!</span>`, nearly everything is possible.\
*GitHub* only‚ùó 5 colors are made available within a **diff** block code snippet, like so (omit backslashes):
```markdown
\```diff
- text in red
+ text in green
! text in orange
# text in gray
@@ text in purple (and bold)@@
\```
```

<br /><hr>

## Links
**Web Addresses**:
```markdown
[monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/)
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />

[monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/)

**Email**:
```markdown
<anthonybenchyep@gmail.com>
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />

<anthonybenchyep@gmail.com>

**Anchor links** (jump links):\
Please note, the "address" for the jump links can't have special characters (apart from hyphen `-` and underscore `_` ) or spaces. The address must be all lower case, with special characters omitted, and spaces replaced with a hyphen `-` along with a trailing special character (for example the header "## hello!" would be addressed as `#hello-` ).\
In *VS Code* ‚ùó you must still include emojis in the address, but for *GitHub* ‚ùó you must omit them.

## Images
There are two image embedding options supported by both flavours. The first is less flexible and more common:
```markdown
![Holochan!](https://i.imgur.com/oTopiyf.jpg)
```

The second is both more flexible, and warrants more discussion. The HTML `<img>` tag can be used to change the scale, set alternative text if the image source address breaks, and even set alignment. While it is unclear why this option is less popular, my guess is, simply, that few know if it:
```markdown
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/jtNwEWu.png" width="200" />
```
You can also add the `align` attribute with either `"left"` or `"right"` as values to set justification, however please be warned that this produces...interesting behavior:
```markdown
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/jtNwEWu.png" align="left" width="200" />
```

<br /><hr>

## Badges (Shields)
There is an extension available for an individual's *GitHub* account called [**Shield.io**](https://shields.io/), which allows you to put some clean looking flaire that provides stats/insights into a repository you might be documenting.\
As the web app linked above generates the markdown for the shield of your choosing, there is no need to provide an example, though here are some widely applicable ones:
```markdown
<!-- License -->
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/anthonybench/Algorithms)
<!-- Top Language -->
![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/anthonybench/Algorithms)
<!-- Language Count -->
![GitHub language count](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/count/anthonybench/anthonybench.github.io)
```
<img alt="example image tag" src="https://i.imgur.com/iXqHf9Y.png" width="50" />

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/anthonybench/Algorithms)
![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/anthonybench/Algorithms)
![GitHub language count](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/count/anthonybench/anthonybench.github.io)
